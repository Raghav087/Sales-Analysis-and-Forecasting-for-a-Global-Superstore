# Sales-Analysis-and-Forecasting-for-a-Global-Superstore
This project was submitted by me as a part of my Data Science curriculum at Indian Institute of Management, Lucknow.

The dataset includes retail store transactions for a global superstore at various levels of granularity- City, Region, Country, Product, Category etc.
The project includes descriptive analysis of the products sold along with their visualizations. We then proceed to forecast the Sales of the Superstore for the next year on a monthly basis using Triple Exponential Smoothing algorithm. This enables the superstore to manage inventory and demand.
